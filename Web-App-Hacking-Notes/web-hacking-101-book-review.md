Web Hacking 101 is a self published book by Peter Yaworski. I received a PDF copy for free when I registered as a bug bounty participant at hackerone.com. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand exactly how the world of bug bounties works and what the actual work is like.

The book is 143 pages of very concise information. It is rather condensed and assumes that the reader has a background in web development. Most of the book is a thorough introduction to the technical aspects of everything described in Chapter 19, called Getting Started. That chapter and the following chapter on bug reports, are, combined with the first 15 pages, valuable insider information about how to navigate the world of bug bounties. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the book, the technical synopses and references, are well written and thankfully devoid of useless boilerplate content. Even more valuable are the several bug bounty case studies. They are written like a breach post-mortem report, including how much money was earned and things like URL parameters.

If you have a background in traditional enterprise penetration testing you may find that this book is describing a small sub-set of a full pen-test. It is almost totally focused on web application vulnerabilities, but it does briefly discuss things like nmap and open daemons. The author seems to have a web development background and his approach is very technical. Most examples rely on input manipulation using a web proxy between your browser and the server hosting the application you're targeting. 

One of the really valuable insights is that he explains how the bug bounty economy works. The short version of this is that you must first go after existing targets which have already been thoroughly tested and hardened. But once you get a few verified "bugs" at these targets then you'll be invited to exclusive bug bounties for new customers of the hackerone.com program. These new customers will not yet have been tested, so they are likely to have several bugs for you to find. They will also have a higher chance of having high-paying bugs like SQL Injection.

Along the way the book also provides concise and detailed explanations of vital but potentially confusing topics like URL encoding, UTF-8 encoding, control characters, etc. I especially enjoyed the chapter on HTML Injection. This surprised me because I almost skipped that chapter. I originally thought that, because I know HTML and have looked at plenty of web server logs showing POST parameters, I must have seen all the tricks that hackers and bots try when interacting with web forms. But there was a lot there for me to learn after all.

I found the detailed technical examples to be free of any errors and to be explained clearly enough that reading through them was enjoyable and interesting. These forensic walk-throughs are what a technical reader is really looking for and they are so clear and innovative that at times the book is hard to put down. But the non-technical parts of the book need a little more polish. I'd say that, if the rest of the presentation and less important parts of the book were written and edited a little more thoroughly, the book would be ready for print publication. But even as it is now the book is a very unique and valuable technical walk through for a person wanting to get into the world of bug bounties.
