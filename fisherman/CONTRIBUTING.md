# How To Contribute To FisherMan
First I want to thank you for wanting to help this humble project.

This project is not very big, so there is not much to do, but there is something you can do that will be of great help.

## Adding Search Filters
Please see the wiki for [Adding filters to the search argument](https://github.com/Godofcoffe/FisherMan/wiki/Adding-filters-to-the-search-argument)
and see the procedure in detail.

I made the search argument to make it easier to understand how to use the "profile names", 
but knowing the link to the profile instead of the name itself might be a little bothersome, so I also implemented filters to help with the search.

Take a look at the [filters.json](https://github.com/Godofcoffe/FisherMan/blob/main/filters.json) and if you have time you can add more cities, 
jobs and/or educational institutions.

## Adding New Functionality
If you have created a new branch and added its functionality, test it and the program as a whole to avoid conflicts and facilitate approval of the pull request.

Also if you have an idea but don't know how to create it in practice or have no idea how to do it, you can send an issue.
